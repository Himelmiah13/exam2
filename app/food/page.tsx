<h1 class= "italic text-pink-700">I have started writing about biryani in a medium today thinking it's been about 15 weeks. But my fascination with biryani dates back much earlier. The fact that this extraordinary and beautiful dish has become a signature dish of the Indian subcontinent has always fascinated me. My journey in search of biryani's secrets has always excited me. It's the enthusiasm and courage I've received from the readers and writers of the medium during this journey that is unparalleled."italic">I am a Dhaka boy. Dhaka is the capital city of Bangladesh, a small but densely populated country of South Asia. What I've eaten as biryani, I've learned it in the lanes of Old Dhaka, and I can say that I've discovered biryani as a food or the sweetness of biryani right in the streets of Dhaka. In the era of globalization, Cuisine from other countries has become easily accessible, and my acquaintances with various types of biryani have expanded. But at the end of the day, Dhaka's biryani has a special place in my heart, and today I will write about Dhaka's biryani. The origins of biryani can be traced back to ancient Persia (modern-day Iran), where a similar dish called "pulao" or "pilaf" was prepared. Pulao is a one-pot dish in which rice is cooked with meat, vegetables, and a medley of aromatic spices. It is believed that the Persian invasions and the spread of the Islamic Empire in the 7th century led to the diffusion of pulao across the Middle East and Central Asia.
The word "biryani" itself is derived from the Persian word "birian," which means "fried before cooking." This refers to the technique of frying the rice in ghee or oil before cooking it with the other ingredients. Some culinary historians also suggest that the name could be derived from the Persian word "berya," which means "to roast" or "to fry." These linguistic connections point to the strong Persian influence on the early forms of biryani.Another theory suggests that biryani has its roots in the nomadic and pastoral cultures of Central Asia, where people relied heavily on rice, meat, and dairy products for sustenance. The dish could have been an efficient way of preparing a hearty meal by combining these staple ingredients with local herbs and spices. As traders and travelers traversed the Silk Road, they would have carried this culinary knowledge with them, eventually introducing it to the Indian subcontinent.The Mughal Influence: The Royal Connection
The Mughal Empire, which ruled over a vast territory that included present-day India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh from the early 16th to the mid-19th century, played a significant role in the popularization and evolution of biryani. The Mughal emperors were known for their love of fine food and elaborate feasts, and they were instrumental in developing and refining the dish to suit their own tastes and the availability of local ingredients.
The royal chefs of the Mughal courts were skilled in the art of blending flavors and aromas, and they experimented with various ingredients, cooking techniques, and presentation styles to create unique and exquisite versions of biryani. The fusion of Persian and Indian culinary traditions under the Mughal rule also led to the development of many other iconic dishes, such as kebabs, kormas, and naan bread.One of the earliest recorded instances of biryani in India can be found in the historical chronicles of the Mughal emperor Babur, who established the Mughal dynasty in 1526. His memoirs mention a feast featuring a dish made from rice, meat, and spices that closely resembles modern-day biryani. Another notable reference to biryani comes from the Ain-i-Akbari, a 16th-century document that details the administration and culture of Emperor Akbar's court. The Ain-i-Akbari describes several rice dishes, including a biryani-like preparation, that were served at the imperial banquets.The Evolution of Regional Biryani Recipes: A Flavorful JourneyAs biryani spread across the Indian subcontinent, it absorbed the flavors and culinary traditions of each region it encountered. This has led to the creation of numerous unique and delectable regional biryanis, each boasting its own distinct taste, ingredients, and cooking methods. The diversity of India's geography, climate, and agricultural resources, as well as its complex social and cultural fabric, have all played a part in shaping these regional variations.For instance, the coastal regions of South India, where seafood is abundant, gave birth to fish and prawn biryanis, while the fertile plains of North India, known for their aromatic basmati rice and rich dairy products, contributed to the development of more indulgent and creamy biryanis. The influence of local communities, such as the Kayastha and Bohri Muslims, the Marathas, and the Chettinad Tamils, has also played a crucial role in the evolution of regional biryani recipes.Here are a few examples of regional biryanis that showcase this diversity:Kolkata BiryaniKolkata Biryani, also known as Calcutta Biryani, is a cherished variant of biryani originating from the city of Kolkata (formerly known as Calcutta) in West Bengal, India. This type of biryani is a delightful mix of flavors, embodying the rich cultural and culinary heritage of Kolkata, a city known for its love of food and literature.Kolkata Biryani evolved from the Lucknowi (or Awadhi) style of biryani when the last Nawab of Awadh, Wajid Ali Shah, was exiled by the British to Kolkata in the mid-19th century. The Nawab brought his royal chefs (khansamas) with him, who adapted the biryani to local tastes and availability of ingredients, leading to the creation of the Kolkata Biryani.What sets Kolkata Biryani apart from other biryanis is its subtle flavoring and the use of unique ingredients. It is less spicy than its southern counterparts, with a milder and lighter flavor profile, yet it doesn't compromise on richness or taste.
The key ingredient in Kolkata Biryani is the meat, usually mutton or chicken, which is marinated in a mixture of yogurt, ginger-garlic paste, and a special biryani masala. Basmati rice, known for its long grains and fragrant aroma, is used in this biryani.One of the distinguishing elements of Kolkata Biryani is the use of potatoes and eggs. The potatoes, often larger in size and halved, are marinated in the same spices as the meat and then cooked together, absorbing the flavors beautifully. The addition of boiled eggs is another unique aspect of this biryani, adding a different texture and flavor to the dish.The cooking process involves layering partially cooked rice with the marinated meat and potatoes in a handi (a deep, narrow-mouthed cooking pot), which is then sealed with dough to trap the steam. This 'dum' style cooking over a low flame allows the flavors to meld together, resulting in a biryani that is aromatic and flavorful.The finished Kolkata Biryani is a delightful experience for the senses. The rice, light and fragrant, is perfectly cooked with each grain separate from the others; the meat is tender and richly flavored; the potatoes, soft and succulent, add a unique and comforting touch; and the boiled eggs provide a satisfying contrast. The dish is traditionally served with raita (a yogurt-based side dish) or a meat or vegetable gravyKolkata Biryani, with its perfect balance of flavors and unique additions, is a true reflection of the city's culinary history and its ability to adapt and absorb influences. It's a testament to the city's love for food and its fondness for nuanced flavors.Kolkata Biryani:
Ingredients:
500g basmati rice
500g mutton or chicken
2 large onions, finely sliced
2 large potatoes, peeled and halved
2 tablespoons ginger-garlic paste
1 cup yogurt
2 teaspoons biryani masala
4 boiled eggs
1/2 cup chopped fresh mint leaves
1/2 cup chopped fresh coriander leaves
4 cups water
4 tablespoons oil or ghee
Salt to taste
Procedure:
Rinse and soak the basmati rice as instructed in the Hyderabadi Biryani recipe.
Marinate the mutton or chicken in the same manner as the Hyderabadi Biryani. Add the potatoes to the marinated meat.
Heat the oil or ghee in a pan. Add the sliced onions and sauté until they turn golden brown.
Add the marinated meat and potatoes to the pan. Cook until the meat is nearly done.
In a separate pot, cook the rice as instructed in the Hyderabadi Biryani recipe.
Layer the partially cooked rice over the cooked meat and potatoes. Place the boiled eggs on top, and then sprinkle the chopped mint and coriander leaves.Cover and cook on low heat for about 30 minutes.
Serve the Kolkata Biryani hot with raita or a meat or vegetable gravy.Kolkata Biryani Pro-tips:
Cook potatoes to perfection: The potatoes are a signature ingredient of Kolkata Biryani. Ensure they are cooked to a perfect tenderness by first parboiling them before frying. This will give them a crispy exterior while maintaining a soft interior.Use kewra water for a unique aroma: To infuse an authentic Kolkata Biryani flavor, add a few drops of kewra water (screw pine essence) while layering the rice and meat. This imparts a delicate, floral aroma to the dish, which is characteristic of Kolkata Biryani.
Use meat on the bone: For a richer flavor, use meat on the bone. The bones add depth to the dish and make it moredeliciousHyderabadi Biryani Hyderabadi Biryani is a traditional Indian dish that originated from the southern city of Hyderabad, India. It's a celebration of flavors, combining elements of Persian and Mughlai cuisines with the influence of local Telugu culinary practices.This biryani is typically made from basmati rice, meat (often chicken or mutton), and a blend of aromatic spices. The unique cooking method and the combination of spices are what sets Hyderabadi Biryani apart. It features a rich blend of natural spices such as cloves, cinnamon, cardamom, ginger, and garlic, along with fresh herbs like mint and coriander.There are two types of Hyderabadi Biryani: Kacchi (raw) Biryani, and Pakki (cooked) Biryani.Kacchi Biryani: In the Kacchi Biryani method, the meat is marinated with spices and yogurt and then layered with partially cooked rice in a handi or heavy-bottomed pot. The pot is then sealed tightly with dough to trap the steam and slow-cooked over a low flame or in an oven until the meat is tender and the flavors are well combined. This method is time-consuming but is said to produce a biryani with more intense flavors and aroma.Pakki Biryani: In the Pakki Biryani method, the meat and rice are cooked separately before being layered in the pot. The pot is then sealed, and the biryani is cooked until the flavors meld together. This method is quicker than the Kacchi Biryani method but is equally flavorful.
The uniqueness of Hyderabadi Biryani lies in the blend of Mughlai and Telugu cuisines, providing it a balance of rich and aromatic flavors. The use of key ingredients like basmati rice, meat (typically goat meat or chicken), and a blend of spices like cloves, cinnamon, ginger, and garlic, along with saffron-infused milk, imparts a distinct aroma and taste to the dish.A hallmark of Hyderabadi Biryani is the use of fried onions, or 'birista', to add a sweet caramelized depth to the flavors. Additionally, fresh herbs like mint and coriander are used liberally, which provide a refreshing contrast to the rich and spicy biryani.Another distinctive feature of Hyderabadi Biryani is the cooking technique. The 'dum' style of cooking, where the biryani is tightly sealed and cooked over a slow fire, allows the flavors to meld and the aromatic spices to permeate the meat and rice, resulting in a dish that is incredibly flavorful and fragrant.Hyderabadi Biryani is traditionally served with Mirchi ka Salan (a spicy curry of green chillies) and Raita (a cooling yogurt-based side dish), which help balance the heat and richness of the biryanHyderabadi Biryani Recipe:
Ingredients:500g basmati rice
500g chicken or mutton
2 large onions, finely sliced
3 green chilies
2 tablespoons ginger-garlic paste
1 cup yogurt
2 teaspoons red chili powder
1/2 teaspoon turmeric powder
2 teaspoons biryani masala
1/2 cup chopped fresh mint leaves
1/2 cup chopped fresh coriander leaves
4 cups water
4 tablespoons oil or ghee
Salt to taste
Procedure:
Rinse the basmati rice in cold water until the water runs clear. Soak the rice in water for 30 minutes, then drain.
Marinate the chicken or mutton with the ginger-garlic paste, yogurt, red chili powder, turmeric, biryani masala, and salt. Let it sit for at least an hour.
In a large pan, heat the oil or ghee. Add the sliced onions and green chilies, and sauté until the onions turn golden brown.
Add the marinated meat to the pan and cook until it's nearly done.
In a separate pot, bring water to a boil. Add the soaked and drained basmati rice to the boiling water. Cook the rice until it's 70% done, then drain the water.
Layer the partially cooked rice over the cooked meat. Sprinkle the chopped mint and coriander leaves on top.
Cover the pot with a tight lid to seal it. Cook on low heat for about 30 minutes to allow the flavors to meld together.Serve the Hyderabadi Biryani hot with raita or a side salad.
Hyderabadi Biryani Pro-tips:Marination is key: For a truly authentic Hyderabadi Biryani, allow the meat to marinate for at least 4-6 hours, or even better, overnight. This ensures that the flavors of the spices, yogurt, and herbs are absorbed deeply into the meat, resulting in a tender, juicy, and flavorful dish.
Perfecting the "dum" technique: To achieve the best results with the "dum" cooking technique, place a heavy-bottomed pan or a griddle (tawa) under the pot to diffuse the heat. This prevents the biryani from burning at the bottom and ensures that the steam is distributed evenly, allowing the rice and meat to cook perfectly.
Use high-quality basmati rice: The quality of rice greatly influences the taste and texture of the biryani. Choose long-grain, aged basmati rice for the best results. Rinse it well before cooking to remove excess starch, which can make the rice sticky.Malabar BiryaniMalabar Biryani, often referred to as Kerala Biryani, is a distinct and flavorful variant of biryani that hails from the Malabar region, located along the southwestern coast of India. This region includes parts of Kerala and Karnataka and is known for its unique and aromatic culinary traditions. Malabar Biryani, with its distinct flavors, is a beloved dish that serves as a testament to the region's rich culinary heritage.Malabar Biryani is differentiated from other types of biryani by its choice of rice, unique set of spices, and cooking techniques. Unlike the long-grain basmati rice typically used in biryanis, Malabar Biryani employs a special kind of short-grain rice known as 'kaima' or 'jeerakasala'. This rice, native to the region, is valued for its robust texture and fragrant aroma, contributing a unique character to the dish.

The preparation of Malabar Biryani involves cooking the meat and rice separately before layering them together. The meat, usually chicken, mutton, beef, or fish, is marinated in a spice blend of garlic, ginger, green chilies, and a mix of powdered spices like turmeric, coriander, and garam masala. It's then slow-cooked to infuse the flavors deeply into the meat.

The rice is cooked with an array of whole spices such as bay leaves, cinnamon, cloves, and cardamom, which impart a delicate aroma to the grains. The layering process involves alternating layers of rice and meat, each generously sprinkled with fried onions, raisins, cashews, and sometimes even boiled eggs, enhancing the dish's complexity and depth of flavor.

One of the defining characteristics of Malabar Biryani is its generous use of ghee (clarified butter), which adds richness and a wonderful aroma to the dish. The cooking process also often involves a dash of rose water or 'kewra' water, enhancing the biryani's fragrant quality.

The pot is then sealed, traditionally with a dough made of flour and water, and placed over a low flame to cook in its own steam. This 'dum' cooking process allows the flavors to mingle and infuse, resulting in a biryani that's aromatic and deeply flavorful.

Malabar Biryani is typically served with a variety of accompaniments, including pickles, raita, pappadum, and a coconut-based vegetable curry. The dish is a delicious medley of flavors – the sweetness of the raisins and fried onions, the heat from the spices, and the savory notes from the meat create a harmony that is both delightful and satisfying. This dish is a culinary jewel that beautifully reflects the rich and diverse food culture of the Malabar region.

2 tablespoons biryani masala
1 cup fried onions (for garnishing)
50g raisins (for garnishing)
50g cashews (for garnishing)
4 cups water
1/2 cup ghee
Salt to taste
For the rice:

4 cloves
2-inch cinnamon stick
4 cardamom pods
2 bay leaves
Procedure:

Rinse the short grain rice in cold water until the water runs clear. Soak the rice in water for 30 minutes, then drain.
Marinate the chicken with ginger paste, garlic paste, green chilies, chopped coriander leaves, mint leaves, yogurt, lemon juice, red chili powder, turmeric powder, biryani masala, and salt. Let it sit for at least 2 hours, or overnight if possible.

Add the marinated chicken to the pan and cook on medium heat until it's nearly done.
In a separate pot, bring water to a boil. Add the cloves, cinnamon stick, cardamom pods, and bay leaves. Then, add the soaked and drained rice to the boiling water. Cook the rice until it's 70% done, then drain the water and remove the whole spices.
In a large heavy-bottomed pot, layer the partially cooked rice over the cooked chicken. Sprinkle the fried onions, raisins, and cashews on top. Dot with the remaining ghee.
Cover the pot with a tight lid to seal it. Cook on low heat for about 30-40 minutes to allow the flavors to meld together (this process is called 'dum').
Serve the Malabar Biryani hot with raita, pappad, and pickle.
Remember, the key to a delicious biryani lies in its marination and slow cooking. The more time you give for the marination, the more flavorful your biryani will be. And slow cooking on 'dum' ensures all the flavors are well absorbed.

Malabar Biryani Pro-tips:
Roast the spices: For a deeper, more intense flavor, lightly roast the whole spices before grinding them into a powder. This adds a smoky, aromatic quality to the Malabar Biryani, enhancing its overall taste.
Use ghee for an authentic taste: Malabar Biryani relies heavily on the rich flavor of ghee (clarified butter). Don't skimp on this ingredient, as it imparts a unique taste and aroma to the dish.
Choose the right rice: Malabar Biryani traditionally uses a unique variety of short-grain rice called kaima or jeerakasala. This rice is more robust and has a distinctive aroma that's essential for the authentic taste of the biryani.
Sindhi Biryani:
Sindhi Biryani is a vibrant and aromatic variant of biryani that originated from the Sindh province of Pakistan, home to the Sindhi community. This region, known for its rich culture and diverse culinary heritage, has contributed many flavorful dishes to the Indian subcontinent, and Sindhi Biryani is one of the most cherished among them.

Sindhi Biryani sets itself apart from other biryanis with its distinct flavors, use of specific ingredients, and unique preparation style. This biryani variant is known for its potent and spicy flavor profile, which is achieved by using a significant amount of green chilies, spices, and souring agents.

The preparation of Sindhi Biryani typically involves marinating the meat, usually mutton or chicken, in a mixture of yogurt and a spice blend of turmeric, red chili powder, coriander, and garam masala. A distinguishing ingredient in Sindhi Biryani is the use of aloo bukhara (dried plums), which imparts a tangy flavor that beautifully balances the spices.

The marinated meat is then cooked with a generous amount of finely chopped onions and tomatoes until it is tender and juicy. Separately, basmati rice is boiled with a bouquet of whole spices such as bay leaves, cloves, cardamom, and star anise, infusing the rice with a subtle fragrance.

Layering is an essential part of Sindhi Biryani preparation. Alternating layers of the cooked meat and partially boiled rice are arranged in a pot, with each layer receiving a scattering of fried onions, fresh mint, and coriander leaves. This is then sealed and cooked on 'dum' (low heat) until the flavors meld together, creating a dish that is aromatic and bursting with flavors.

Another unique aspect of Sindhi Biryani is the garnishing. It's often garnished with thinly sliced fried potatoes, boiled eggs, and a squeeze of fresh lemon, adding another layer of texture and flavor to the dish.

Sindhi Biryani is typically served with a side of raita (a yogurt-based condiment) or a simple salad of sliced onions and tomatoes. Its tangy, spicy, and flavorful profile is a reflection of the Sindhi community's bold and hearty culinary tradition. Every bite of Sindhi Biryani is a celebration of the region's rich cultural heritage, making it a beloved dish across borders and communities.

Sindhi Biryani Pro-tips:
Balance the tanginess: Sindhi Biryani is known for its tangy flavor, which comes from tomatoes and dried plums (aloo bukhara). To balance this tanginess, add a pinch of sugar or a spoonful of yogurt to the gravy while cooking the meat.
Fry the onions to a golden brown: Fried onions are an essential component of Sindhi Biryani. Be sure to fry the onions to a perfect golden brown before adding them to the meat or layering them with the rice. This adds a rich, caramelized flavor to the dish.
Use fresh mint and coriander: Sindhi Biryani is typically garnished with fresh mint and coriander leaves. These herbs add a refreshing touch and enhance the overall flavor of the biryani.
Ambur Biryani
Ambur Biryani, also known as Arcot Biryani, is a flavorful variant of biryani that originated from the small town of Ambur in Tamil Nadu, India. It is one of the most popular types of biryani in the southern part of India, particularly in the states of Tamil Nadu and Karnataka. This biryani variant is known for its unique flavor profile, cooking technique, and choice of rice.

The uniqueness of Ambur Biryani lies in the type of rice used - Seeraga Samba, a short-grained fragrant rice that is grown extensively in the states of Tamil Nadu and Karnataka. This rice is smaller than the usual basmati rice used in most biryanis but packs an aromatic punch and absorbs the flavors beautifully, making it ideal for this dish.

Ambur Biryani is typically prepared with mutton, chicken, or beef, and it is the preparation of the meat that gives this biryani its distinct flavor. The meat is marinated with a mixture of curd, red chili powder, turmeric, and a blend of special spices before being cooked. The use of curd in the marinade not only tenderizes the meat but also imparts a tangy flavor to the biryani.

A key component of Ambur Biryani is the spice-infused oil, or ghee, used in the preparation. The cooking process usually begins with the frying of spices such as cloves, cinnamon, and cardamom in oil or ghee, which is then used to cook the onions and tomatoes. This spice-infused oil provides a rich base that enhances the overall flavor of the biryani.

The layering of Ambur Biryani is another crucial step that contributes to its unique taste. The partially cooked meat and rice are layered in a pot, often with a sprinkle of coriander and mint leaves between the layers. The pot is then sealed and cooked on a low flame, allowing the flavors to meld together and the rice to absorb the rich, spicy juices from the meat.

Ambur Biryani is traditionally served with a side of 'brinjal curry' (eggplant curry) or 'ennai kathirikai' (spicy brinjal gravy) and 'raitha' (yogurt-based side dish). It is less oily than other types of biryani and has a moderate spice level, making it palatable to a wide range of tastes.

The result is a biryani that is flavorful, aromatic, and deeply satisfying. Every mouthful of Ambur Biryani offers a taste of the rich culinary heritage of the region, and its popularity has only grown over the years, making it a beloved dish not only in its hometown but also across the country.

Ambur Biryani Pro-tips:
Soak the seeraga samba rice: To achieve the perfect texture in Ambur Biryani, soak the seeraga samba rice for at least 30 minutes before cooking. This allows the rice to absorb water and cook evenly, resulting in a fluffy and separate texture.
Cook the salna separately: For an authentic Ambur Biryani experience, cook the spicy tomato-based gravy (salna) separately and serve it as a side dish. This allows diners to customize the level of spiciness and moisture in their biryani according to their preference.
Use meat with bones: Similar to Kolkata Biryani, using meat with bones in Ambur Biryani enhances the depth of flavor. The marrow in the bones adds richness to the biryani, making it tastier.
Biryani is not just a dish, it's an emotion. It carries the flavor of rich history and the essence of various cultures. Its diverse range of styles and flavors, from the mild Kolkata biryani to the tangy Ambur biryani, and from the spicy Hyderabadi biryani to the robust Malabar biryani, is a testament to the culinary diversity of the Indian subcontinent and its neighboring regions.

Whether it's the layered Dum Biryani or the mixed Kacchi Biryani, the delicacy is the perfect balance of rice, meat, and spices, making it a complete meal in itself. The charm of biryani doesn't stop at the dining table. The art of making biryani, which involves careful selection of ingredients, meticulous preparation, and slow cooking, is a gastronomic adventure that every food lover should undertake.
